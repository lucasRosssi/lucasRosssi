# ðŸ“± Hey there, I'm Lucas! I'm a software and game developer.

ðŸŽ® I had my first contact with programming in an old fighting game that I used to play that had an easy to read data file. One day, I got curious of what would happen if I changed some text lines in this file and had a lot of fun with the resulting overpowered characters, and finally got to beat the final boss.

ðŸ’» Today, I found myself in the development area, and I'm currently focusing studies and career in game development.

ðŸŽ¯ Always willing to learn what it takes to do a good job.
